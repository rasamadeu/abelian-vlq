MAIN OBJECTIVE:

- Determine the maximally restrictive pairs (M_u, M_d) of texture zeros for
  a SM extension with 1 up VLQ. We consider that the mass of the lightest 
  quarks (up and down) may be generated by radiative corrections.
  
PHYSICS:

- For the general case of a SM extension with n_u up and n_d down 
  isosinglet VLQ, the mass matrices M_u AND M_d are (3+n_u)X(3+n_u) 
  and (3+n_d)X(3+n_d) complex matrices.
  
- The weak basis transformations are given by unitary matrices K_u_L, K_u_R,
  K_d_L, K_d_R :
  
  M_u --> K_u_L @ M_u @ K_u_R    M_d --> K_d_L @ M_d @ K_d_R
  
  K_u_R \in U(3 + n_u)  \  K_d_R \in U(3 + n_d)
  
  The matrices K_u_L and K_d_L are given by:
  
  K_u_L = |A_L(3X3)    0(3Xn_u)   |
  	  |0(n_uX3) D_u_L(n_uXn_u)|

  K_d_L = |A_L(3X3)    0(3Xn_d)   |
  	  |0(n_dX3) D_d_L(n_dXn_d)|
  	  
- For the specific case where n_u = 1 and n_d = 0:

  K_u_R \in U(4)  \  K_d_R \in U(3)
  
  K_u_L = |A_L(3X3)    0   |
  	  |   0        1   |

  K_d_L = A_L(3X3)

- Since we consider that the up and down quarks might be massless at tree level,
  after perfoming a rotation to the mass basis:
  
  M --> (U_L)^dag M (U_R) = D = diag(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_U)
  
  one of the masses m_1/2/3 might be 0, but m_U/D has to be non-zero. 
  Thus we can have 4 distinct cases:
  
         | M_u | M_d  
 	 |  4  |  3
 Singular|  4  |  2
 values  |  3  |  3
 	 |  3  |  2

- The quark mixing in the charged currents is given by a non-unitary 4X3 matrix V:

  V = |V_ud V_us V_ub| = |              |
      |V_cd V_cs V_cb|   |     V_CKM    |
      |V_td V_ts V_tb|   |______________|
      |V_Ud V_Us V_Ub|	 |V_Ud V_Us V_Ub|
  
CODE:

  We are only interested in texture zeros that are allowed by experimental data.
  Thus, each mass matrix must be able to generate the masses of the quarks. 
  The mass matrices M_u/M_d must contain a number of texture zeros <= (dim**2 - number of masses),
  where dim is the dimension of the mass matrix.
  If the mass matrices are able to generate the masses of the quarks after bidiagonalization,
  we must check if the matrix V is able to generate the 3 mixing angles and the Dirac phase of
  V_CKM matrix. The mass of the quark U must be non-zero, so the entry (4,4) of D_u must be nonzero
  (we can't rotate other diagonal elements through WB transformations to the entry (4,4)).
  
  -ALGORITHM:
    
    n_zeros_up = dim_up**2 - number of masses up
    n_zeros_down = dim_down**2 - number of masses down
    While (n_zeros_down <= dim_down**2 - number of masses down):
      maximally_restrictive_pair = false
    	While not maximally_restrictive_pair:
	  Construct non-equivalent pairs (M_u, M_d) with n_zeros_up and n_zeros_down
	  Run through non-equivalent pairs:
            If non-equivalent pair generates masses for quarks and mix. angles + Dirac phase of V_CKM:
	      maximally_restrictive_pair = true
	      Save non-equivalent pair to set of maximally_restrictive_pairs.
	  n_zeros_down -= 1
	n_zeros_down += 2  # If (n_zeros_up, n_zeros_down) contains maximally_restrictive_pairs, the next
	                   # set of maximally_restrictive_pairs is given by (n_zeros_up - 1, n_zeros_down + 1)
