# abelian-vlq

A Python codebase to explore 2HDM extended with isosinglets vector-like quarks (VLQ) and Abelian flavour symmetries.

## Introduction

A recent result in the first row of the CKM matrix known as the Cabbibo angle anomaly. 

## Prerequisites

This project was written in Python. As a result, you must install a Python interpreter. There is a lot of information on
how to install Python online. In my case, since I'm working with Ubuntu, I installed it via apt:

``
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
``
